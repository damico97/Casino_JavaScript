	- Created a Basic view to show both player's hands, using image views that are hardcoded.

	- Added the ability to click on the cards to select them and highlight the background to show
	that the cards have been selected.

TOTAL: 45 Minutes


Jan 1, 2019:
	- Added the table view, having to create my own view handler, similar to a Recycler View in Android
	so I can have any number of cards but also have an index assosiated with each card so we can understand
	which card the user has clicked on.
	(2 Hours)

	- Added the ability for the user to trail a card from it's hand
	(30 Minutes)

	- Created a custom scroll bar for the entire html page so that if the program is ran on a windows maching, 
	the scroll bar doesn't look like it's from Windows 95
	(15 Minutes)

	- Changed the human's hand view to use the custom indexed view adapter that I created for the Table so we don't
	have to use the hardcoded image views for the human's hand. At this time I left the computers hand with the hardcoded
	views because we do not have to click on anything their. It's just for show.
	(45 Mintues)
TOTAL: 3.5 Hours
