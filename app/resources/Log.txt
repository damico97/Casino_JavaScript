	- Watched a few tutorials for working in this envorinment
	(1 Hour 30 Minutes)

	- Ported the Card Class into JavaScript
	(45 Minutes)

	- Created the initial view for the game, basing it off the tutorial that I watched 
	on YouTube
	(1 Hour)
TOTAL: 3.25 Hours


Dec 27, 2018:
	- Ported the Deck Class into JavaScript, and did the documentation of for the class
	(45 Minutes)

Dec 28, 2018:
	- Created a Basic view to show both player's hands, using image views that are hardcoded.
	This was mostly done to prove that the game was working when dealing cards to both players.
	(45 Minutes)
TOTAL: 45 Minutes


Dec 29, 2018:
	- Added the ability to click on the cards to select them and highlight the background to show
	that the cards have been selected.
	(45 Minutes)
TOTAL: 45 Minutes


Jan 1, 2019:
	- Added the table view, having to create my own view handler, similar to a Recycler View in Android
	so I can have any number of cards but also have an index assosiated with each card so we can understand
	which card the user has clicked on.
	(2 Hours)

	- Added the ability for the user to trail a card from it's hand
	(30 Minutes)

	- Created a custom scroll bar for the entire html page so that if the program is ran on a windows maching, 
	the scroll bar doesn't look like it's from Windows 95
	(15 Minutes)

	- Changed the human's hand view to use the custom indexed view adapter that I created for the Table so we don't
	have to use the hardcoded image views for the human's hand. At this time I left the computers hand with the hardcoded
	views because we do not have to click on anything their. It's just for show.
	(45 Mintues)
TOTAL: 3.5 Hours

	- The user can now capture cards, had to work out a bunch of bugs, which required me to learn how passing objects works
	in JavaScript.
	(2 Hours 15 Minutes)

	- Created the view for the human's pile
	(30 Minutes)

	- Extended the player's class to handel the pile and making a capture move.
	(15 Minutes)
TOTAL: 3 Hours


Jan 5, 2019:
	- Started testing how to have multiple view pages in the HTML File so we can have multiple views throughout the game
	without loosing all the game data
	(30 Minutes)
